Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.
Brainfuck is an esoteric language designed to be as nonsensical and unreadable as possible. It works by having a array of cells which can store integers up to 2^8 integers from 0-255. A pointer is controller by a series of operators(+,-,<,>)
+ increments the current cell the pointer is at and - decrements it
> shifts the pt to the right, while < shifts the pt to the left

My code allows users to run their brainfuck code while being able to view the pointers and cells visually in 3D.
I hope you will find my project at least some what complicated.
